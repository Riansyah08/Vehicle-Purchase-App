# 🚗 Vehicle Purchase App – Final Project for Object-Oriented Visual Programming
This repository contains our **University Final Project** for the **Object-Oriented Visual Programming** course. Developed by a team of three students, the application is built using **Java** on **Apache NetBeans**, and connected to a **SQL database** for data storage.
<br><br>

### 📌 Project Overview
In this project, we created a **GUI-based desktop application** that allows users to:
- 🛒 Purchase a vehicle from a list
- 🧾 Fill out personal identity information
- 💳 Enter card/payment details
- 💾 Save all user and transaction data to a **SQL database**
<br><br>

### 💻 Technologies Used
- Java
- Apache NetBeans (Swing GUI)
- MySQL / SQL database
<br><br>

### 🧪 How It Works
1. The user selects a vehicle to purchase.
2. They fill in their personal details and card information.
3. Upon confirmation, the data is stored securely in the connected SQL database.
4. The GUI provides validation and feedback on form input.
<br><br>

### 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Open the project in **Apache NetBeans**.
2. Ensure your **SQL server is running** and the correct database is created.
3. Update any necessary **DB connection credentials** in the source code.
4. Run the main class (GUIFP.java or equivalent).
